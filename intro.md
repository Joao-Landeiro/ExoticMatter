    After countless conversations and nerding out together on this stuff, I was sure he would be a phenomenal start to the inaugural season of Exotic Matter.

    ✺ Danilo's reservations with over reliance on "Productization" as a silver-bullet<br>

    <br>
Danilo and I spoke about these and other topics, all related to the unique aspects of Marketing Boutique Consulting firms. Danilo's experience shines through.

Florian did not let me off the hook with this one. His many flight hours manifested in the way he clarified subtle nuance and how he gave very palpable examples of real application.

I've followed his work for a couple of years and we've been chatting for a little over one year. There's a clear connection between how his work highlights the power of a Signature Methodology and my own belief that Workshops are a phenomenal tool for Consulting firms.

Alex and I had to do this twice. The first time, the gods of inter-continental communications were not on our side. It was so worth it to double down on it. Wrath of Gods be damned.

Like so many, I was struck by his impeccable carousels on LinkedIn. Seeing that being their brilliance there must be a really clever and creative mind, I got in touch. From there, some of the freshest conversations I've had for a while. Bringing Alex on was a no-brainer.

Dylan and I discussed these topics mostly around how Experts can be found on LinkedIn. At some point Dylan caught me falling into old over-thinking patterns. See if you can spot this.

    We initially met when Dylan made me see something that had been in front of all our eyes for a long time. That "slap-my-forehead" moment was only the first of our conversations. So many experts struggle with reach on LinkedIn and I knew Dylan could help make a few things clearer.

Kurt is on top of his game. But he want you to reach that place too. The amount of sharing and co-learning is off the charts. I wish I had started speaking to Kurt much sooner.
