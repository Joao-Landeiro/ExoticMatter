    "guest": "<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickkizny/\"><b>Patrick Kizny</b></a> is an entrepreneurial creative at heart. After decades running creative businesses of all kinds, he's now working on spatial sound. He's also a friend. We first spoke regarding ideas for a deck of cards that would productize Patrick's methodology. But our calls evolved from that. When I need honest feedback and a clinical attention to detail, I turn to Patrick."
